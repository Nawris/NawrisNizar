          <p>NASA stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA is a United States government agency
             that is responsible for science and technology related to air and space.
             The Space Age started in 1957 with the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik. NASA was created in 1958.</p>

          <p>Plans for human spaceflight began in the U.S.
             Armed Forces prior to NASA's creation.
              The Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and the Army's 
              Project Adam served as the foundation for Project Mercury,
             the first American program to put people in space</p>

          <p>To develop the spaceflight skills and equipment required for a lunar mission,
             NASA initiated Project Gemini. Using a modified Air Force Titan II launch vehicle,
              the Gemini capsule could hold two astronauts for flights of over two weeks. Gemini 
              pioneered the use of fuel cells instead of legacy batteries and demonstrated spacewalks and rendezvous operations. 
              NASA also needed more detained information about the Moon's geography and composition to prepare for a landing,
             using three uncrewed spacecraft programs.</p>
